# JavaScript_JSON_Email_Hunt
Identifying all emails in a JSON file using JavaScript, JQuery and Ajax.


JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON stores data that is both machine and human readable. 
JSON does this by formatting data as array text files.
This series of scripts is written to demonstrate the process of hunting and identifying for emails in a JSON file and mapping out their frequency occurrences.
The script can be used for data mining, pattern matching, machine learning and to curate trending topics.
The scripts make use of JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax, HTML and JSON files.
The Script is written by Vakindu Philliam.
